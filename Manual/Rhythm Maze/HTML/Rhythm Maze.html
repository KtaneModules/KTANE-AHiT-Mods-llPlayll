                <h2>On the Subject of Rhythm Maze</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Your flavor text should go here.</p>

                <p>Initially, this module will have a single button in the center to start it. The button may either be a crown in a yellow circle, or a purple blob.</p>
                <p>Normally, the button is going to be a crown in a yellow circle, refer to <b>Section Normal Mode</b> for operating the module in that case.
                    However, if the bomb contains the module "Snatcher's Map", this module will enter <b>Death Wish mode</b>, signified by the button in the center turning into the purple blob.
                    It is recommended that both the defuser and the expert are familiar with normal mode before trying out the Death Wish mode. Refer to <b>Section Collapse</b> for operating the Death Wish mode.</p>
                <p>If the module enters Death Wish mode via that case, a button in the bottom-left corner of the moduele will appear. Pressing it will disable Death Wish mode, at a cost of a strike.</p>
                <p>Death Wish mode may also be forced through Mod Settings, or a command on "Twitch Plays". If Death Wish mode was forced, the button to disable it will not appear in the bottom left.</p>
                
                <h2>Section Normal Mode</h2>
                <p>After starting the module, you will see a display with a 6x6 grid of white squares with one of them being red, and 4 arrows for movement. The module will also play a song, which may be muted/unmuted by pressing the status light.</p>
                <p>The module will switch between two sides - a <b>P</b>ink and a <b>B</b>lue side. Each side will have two grids - a Markings Grid, and a Maze of walls.</p>

                <p>GRIDSGRIDSGRIDSGRIDSGRIDS</p>

                <p>To solve the module, you must shift the mazes according to the markings, then navigate the <b>Red Square</b> to 5 pons and then an exit, coordinates of which must also be calculated. In this manual, coordinates are kept in the format of "(Row, Column)", where top-left is (1, 1).</p>

            </div>
            <div class="page-content">
                <p>To shift the mazes for each side:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>On the module, the top-left 3x3 quadrant of the 6x6 grid will display a pattern of markings, which may be found in that side's Markings Grid (the grid doesn't wrap around, which means that each side has 16 3x3 patterns)</li>
                    <li>Note down the coordinate of the top-left cell of the pattern from the Markings grid. Let variables R be the row of that coordinate, and C - the column.</li>
                    <li>Shift the side's Maze to the left by [C - 1], and up by [R - 1]. The coordinate you noted down earlier should become the top-left cell of the Maze.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Next, determine the pons and the exit. Take the serial number, and for each character:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If it is a letter: it becomes its alphabetic position (A1Z26).</li>
                    <li>If it is a "0": it becomes 1.</li>
                    <li>If it is a number 1-9: keep it as it is</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You should end up with 6 numbers, and for each of them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Subtract 1 from it.</li>
                    <li>Take the number modulo 6.</li>
                    <li>Add 1.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You will get a list of 6 numbers in range 1-6.</p>
                <p>Pair 1st and 2nd number, 2nd and 3rd number, and so on until you pair 5th and 6th number. The 5 pairs refer to the pon coordinates, where the first number is the row, and the second is the column.</p>
                <p>If you have any duplicate coordinates, keep moving the duplicate coordinate in reading until it is unique, wrapping around from (6, 6) to (1, 1)
                    (For example, if your serial number is FF6FF6 your pons should all be pair 66, so we move the duplicates in reading order, getting pairs 66, 11, 12, 13 and 14).</p>
                <p>Pair the 1st number of the list with 6th to get the pair that refers to the exit coordinate same way as before. If this coordinate is already a pon, keep moving it in reading order until it isn't.</p>

                    <p>Once you have figured out all the goal coordinates, navigate the <b>red square</b> to 3 out of the 5 pon coordinates to open the exit. 
                        Every time you navigate the red square to one of the pons, you will collect it, and the defuser will hear the collected amount of pons in total being said out loud, with 3 being "Got 'em!" and 5 being "All mine!".
                    </p>
                    <p>After collecting 3 pons (the other 2 don't have to be collected), navigate the defuser to the exit coordinate to solve the module.
                        If the defuser visits the exit with less than 3 pons, they will hear a voice clip saying "Hmmm...".
